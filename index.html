            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Mikayla Remolacio. I was born on December 19th, 2004</p><br>
            <p>From my early days, I’ve always been driven by a sense of curiosity—whether it was tinkering with gadgets, solving problems, or simply wondering how things work. That curiosity led me to the world of STEM, where I found a passion for both creation and innovation.</p>

            <h2>My Proudest Moments</h2>
            <h3>Being a Mechatronics Skills Competitor</h3>

            <p>I competed in Mechatronics Skills twice, which was an incredible opportunity to challenge myself and apply both my technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities. These competitions pushed me to think creatively and work under pressure, as I had to troubleshoot and solve complex mechanical and electrical problems. Participating twice not only improved my hands-on skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, precision, and time management. It was a rewarding experience that strengthened my passion for technology and engineering, while also preparing me for future challenges in my field.</p>

            <p>As a STEM developer, I am passionate about teaching kids about the STEM field and inspiring them to explore the possibilities it offers. Through workshops and hands-on activities, I introduce them to concepts in science, technology, engineering, and math in a fun and engaging way. My goal is to spark their curiosity and show them how STEM can be used to solve real-world problems. By sharing my own experiences and the exciting opportunities in the field, I hope to encourage them to pursue a career in STEM, knowing that they can make a meaningful impact in the future.</p>

            <h2>What I do Outside of School and Work</h2>
            <p>Photography and skateboarding are two hobbies that allow me to express creativity in very different ways. Through photography, I capture the world as I see it—finding beauty in small details and freezing moments in time. It's a way for me to reflect on the world around me. Skateboarding, on the other hand, gives me a sense of freedom and adrenaline, pushing my physical limits while enjoying the thrill of movement. Both allow me to challenge myself, whether it’s landing a new trick or framing the perfect shot.</p>
